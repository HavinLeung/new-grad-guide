# A guide to getting your California Driver's License

So you just moved to California, and found out you can't do anything in this state without a car? Welcome to the US!

If you already have a Canadian driver's license, the good news is that you are good to drive and rent a car while you are living here, but doing this long term is a legally grey area. The state does recognize foreign licenses, but you have to *apply* for a California driver's license within ten days of becoming a resident. There will be no automatic consequences if you fail to do this, but you are risking a pretty hefty fine ($1000+) if you are caught in a traffic stop.

California does not accept international license transfers, even if you have an international driver's permit. So regardless of your driving ability, you will have to go through the whole new driver licensing process. Plus, the process is extremely confusing and inconsistent depending on which DMV you go to, or even who is serving you.

If you already have an American license, then great, you can just get it transfered through a visit to the DMV. Otherwise, you are about to get on a wild ride.

Unfortunately, the image of dealing with the DMV in popular culture isn't exaggerated. Getting your license can be frustrating and you might hit arcane setbacks. Worse yet, calling the DMV often means being put on hold for hours. So, hopefully this guide can help demystify the process for you.

## Getting your license in 3 ~EZ~ extremely painful steps


### Getting your paperwork in order

You must first make [an appointment](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/make-an-appointment/) with the DMV, [fill your application](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/) online, and optionally upload your documents ahead of time. To be able to apply for a license, you must supply a proof of residency, and of legal presence (list [here](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/how-do-i-get-a-real-id/real-id-checklist/)). Some examples of documents you need to bring are your lease, *original* SSN (or W-2), visa documentation, passport, and your application.

Even if you uploaded your documents online, you will still need to bring them in-person to the DMV for validation! So bring them over or you'll have to go back again!

Appointment does not mean you will be seen at that exact time, but it does let you skip the line. Do not queue up in the big line if you have an appointment!

As TN/H1 visa holders it is unclear if we are eligible to get a Real ID, but you do not have to opt in for it if you choose not to. Sometimes the clerks at the DMV will refuse to give you one. Having a Real ID or not is really not a big deal, because your passport, NEXUS card, or Canadian driver's license can all act as one when you need to board a flight.

Some people have encountered issues getting their passport scanned at the appointment, asking them to try again helps, but they might have to send your passport photocopy to the headquarters in Sacramento which is not great, as it will mean a long processing time.

### Aceing your knowledge test
After your initial paperwork appointment, you can do your written test. You can come back for it, or do it as part of the same DMV visit. The knowledge test is extremely easy and consists of a number of multiple choice questions on a computer. You can read more about it, and see some sample. questions [here](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/preparing-for-knowledge-and-drive-tests/), or [here](https://driving-tests.org/california/)!

Once you pass the knowledge test, you will be directed to get a picture taken, and a learner's permit will be given to you.


### Do your driving test

The driving test is probably the most complicated part of the process. Your first obstacle would be to [obtain an appointment](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/foa/findDriveTest.do) with the DMV. They are farily overbooked with the behind-the-wheel tests and you can expect to wait weeks for an available time slot for your test.

Try to book for a slot earlier in the day, because once again, the appointment time does not mean you will be doing your test at the time. If there's a backlog of drivers in front of you, you might be asked to wait, and potentially have to come back another time if you cannot start your test before 4:30 PM. The DMV is also not open on Sundays, so you will likely have to take your test sometime in the weekday, unless if you are lucky enough to score a Saturday test slot.

Once you have your appointment booked, you need to consider some logistical hurdles. Since you are _technically_ a driver with a learner's license, you are supposed to drive to the DMV for your test with an adult driver with the California license, even if you have a foreign driver's license. The enforcement of this rule is *very* inconsistent. The author of this guide has called the DMV for advice, and was informed that you can just drive yourself as a Canadian driver, however, the clerks at the DMV have rejected people for not bringing an extra driver. So, it's better to play it safe and bring a friend or coworker for your test.

You will also be required to bring a vehicle to do the test with. It can be your car, a friend's car (but they have to come with you), a rental car, or acquiring a car through a driving school/service like YoGov. If you choose to bring you or a friend's car, you will need to bring the car registration and insurance documentation. 

You can rent a car for the test, but you need to rent through a car rental company that allows their cars to be used for tests. You will need the car rental clerk but you will need to ask them to provide you with a letter explicitly allowing the car to be used for a test, and opt-in for all insurance packages. I've had success renting through Hertz for my test. You will have to show your rental agreement, proof of insurance (your rental agreement should have this), and the letter when you visit the DMV.

On the day of your test, you will need to show up (slightly) early to the DMV. You will need to first get your papers verified by a clerk, who will then give you instructions for the next steps. You will then drive your car to the test area and wait for a examiner to get in your car. 

The driving test is fairly easy, and involves some maneuvers like switching lanes, making some turns at intersections and stop signs, and backing up your car. There are no highway or parallel parking components to the test. You should expect to be driving for about 15 to 20 minutes for the test from the start to the end.

Once you have finished the test, you will be given a temporary paper license and your actual license will come in the mail! The expiration date on the license will be set to the same time your visa is set to expire.
