# A guide to getting your California Driver's License

So you just moved to California, and found out you can't do anything in this state without a car? Welcome to the US!

If you already have a Canadian driver's license, the good news is that you are good to drive and rent a car while you are living here, but doing this long term is a legally grey area. The state does recognize foreign licenses, but you have to *apply* for a California driver's license within ten days of becoming a resident. There will be no automatic consequences if you fail to do this, but you are risking a pretty hefty fine ($1000+) if you are caught in a traffic stop.

California does not accept international license transfers, even if you have an international driver's permit. So regardless of your driving ability, you will have to go through the whole new driver licensing process. Plus, the process is extremely confusing and inconsistent depending on which DMV you go to, or even who is serving you.

Unfortunately, the image of dealing with the DMV in popular culture isn't exaggerated. Getting your license can be frustrating and you might hit arcane setbacks. So, hopefully this guide can help demystify the process for you.

## Getting your license in 3 ~EZ~ extremely painful steps


### Getting your paperwork in order

You must first make [an appointment](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/make-an-appointment/) with the DMV, [fill your application](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/dl-id-online-app-edl-44/) online, and optionally upload your documents ahead of time. To be able to apply for a license, you must supply a proof of residency, and of legal presence (list [here](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/how-do-i-get-a-real-id/real-id-checklist/)). Some examples of documents you need to bring are your lease, *original* SSN, visa documentation, passport, and your application.

Even if you uploaded your documents online, you will still need to bring them in-person to the DMV for validation! So bring them over or you'll have to go back again!

Appointment does not mean you will be seen at that exact time, but it does let you skip the line.

As TN/H1 visa holders we are eligible to get a Real ID, but you do not have to opt in for it if you choose not to. Sometimes the clerks at the DMV will refuse to give you one.



### Aceing your knowledge test
After your initial paperwork appointment, you can do your written test. You can come back for it, or do it as part of the same DMV visit. The knowledge test is extremely easy and consists of a number of multiple choice questions on a computer. You can read more about it, and see some sample. questions [here](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/preparing-for-knowledge-and-drive-tests/).

Once you pass the knowledge test, you will be directed to get a picture taken, and a learner's permit will be given to you.


### Do your driving test

The driving test is probably the most complicated part of the process. Your first obstacle would be to [obtain an appointment](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/foa/findDriveTest.do) with the DMV. They are farily overbooked with the behind-the-wheel tests and you can expect to wait weeks for an available time slot for your test.

Try to book for a slot earlier in the day, because once again, the appointment time does not mean you will be doing your test at the time. If there's a backlog of drivers in front of you, you might be asked to wait, and potentially have to come back another time if you cannot start your test before 4:30 PM.

Once you have your appointment booked, you need to consider some logistical hurdles. Since you are
